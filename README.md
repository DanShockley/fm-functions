# fm-functions
Collection of useful custom functions, stored in the XML format that FileMaker uses when copying one or more custom functions from the Manage Custom Functions interface. 
The raw XML of each function is stored in its file. 

Note: to convert between plain text XML and the XML-object format needed for actually pasting back INTO FileMaker, use the AppleScript code found at https://github.com/DanShockley/FmClipTools

The attached template.XML file can provide a template to be used when creating a new function. Documentation sections that are empty should be removed.
