// version 1.5, NYHTC

/*
	Determine if the user can view a record, setting the OrgNum (and creating a record FOR that), as needed.


REQUIRES:
	_Access_MultiTenant_isActive
	SessionOrgNum


HISTORY:
	1.5 - 2018-01-05 ( eshagdar ): If the recordOrgNum is set to 0, then show the record to all orgNums; specifying 'Yes' on the record-view for a table instead of using this calc leaves logically deleted records visible until SSP has gone through and deleted them. recordOrgNum should be compared to the SessionOrgNum function instead of the AccountPrivilegeSetName ( since the accountName may be the one with the suffix and not the privSet ).
	1.4 - 2017-09-22 ( eshagdar ): if the record is logically deleted, it should NEVER show. use privSet suffix to check orgNum.
	1.3.2 - 2017-01-26 ( eshagdar ): updated docuemntation with schema requirenments.
	1.3.1 - 2016-09-29 ( eshagdar ): updated documentation.
	1.3 - 201x-xx-xx ( xxxxx ): remove all SQL since it fails in Find mode. Compare record's OrgNum to session's OrgNum ( in a00_TimesSq ).
	1.2 - 201x-xx-xx ( xxxxx ): Set local file's global orgNum if needed ( create Interface record if one doesn't exist, otherwise just set it ).
	1.1 - 201x-xx-xx ( xxxxx ): 
	1.0 - 201x-xx-xx ( xxxxx ): first created.
