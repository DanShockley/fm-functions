// version 1.2, Daniel A. Shockley

/* 
	Escapes a string to work within SQL


VERSION HISTORY:
	1.2 - Reformatted to match newer standards.
	1.1 - Don't just wrap in single quotes, escape internal single-quotes. This is enough for literal strings. Can get more involved with LIKE statements where wildcards can be a factor. There are probably other situations with more advanced SQL statements, as well. 
	1.0 - initial version.
